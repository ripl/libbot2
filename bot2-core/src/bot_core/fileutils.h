 * filename is constructed as path/[date-]basename.XX.extension where
 * XX is an integer chosen to make it unique.  date- is only included
 * if @time_prefix is 1.
 *
 * @path: The path to the directory where the file should be stored.
 *    Pass NULL to use the current working directory or if the path
 *    is already included in @basename.
 * @basename: The desired name of the file without any trailing extension.
 *    This may include a leading path, but only if @time_prefix is zero.
 * @time_prefix: Set to 1 if the basename should be prefixed with the
 *    current date in the format YYYY-MM-DD-.
 * @extension: Filename extension to be used.  Use NULL if no extension
 *    is desired.
