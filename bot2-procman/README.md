# RobotLocomotion Fork of bot2-procman

*Process management tools for controlling many processes on one or many
workstations*

![CI](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/libbot2/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

Procman is a tool for managing many processes distributed over one or more
computers. There are two ways to use procman:

## Sheriff / Deputy Mode

In this mode, every workstation runs a `bot-procman-deputy` process. One
workstation runs a `bot-procman-sheriff` process, which provides a GUI to
command and communicate with the deputies.

Using the GUI, you can:

* create new processes
* start, stop, restart processes
* aggregate processes together into logical groups (e.g., "Planning")
* view the standard output of each process (redirected by deputies)
* save and load process configuration files
* view process statistics (memory used, CPU% used)

## Lone Ranger Mode

This mode is primarily useful when you only want to run processes on the local
computer. In this mode, the sheriff acts as its own deputy. To operate in lone
ranger mode, run:

```
bot-procman-sheriff --lone-ranger
```

or with `-l`, but `--lone-ranger` is cooler.
