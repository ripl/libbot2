# RobotLocomotion Fork of bot2-frames

*C library that manages a set of coordinate frames*

![CI](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/libbot2/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

bot2-frames reads the coordinate frame setup information from a parameter file
stored by bot2-param.

## Parameter File Format

bot2-frames assumes a specific parameter file format, an example of which is
shown below:

```
coordinate_frames {
  root_frame = "local";  # a root_frame must be defined
  body {
    relative_to = "local";
    history = 1000;                    # number of past transforms to keep
                                       # around
    update_channel = "BODY_TO_LOCAL";  # transform updates will be listened for
                                       # on this channel
    initial_transform {
      translation = [ 0, 0, 0 ];  # (x,y,z) translation vector
      quat = [ 1, 0, 0, 0 ];      # may be specified as a quaternion, rpy,
                                  # Rodrigues, or axis-angle
    }
  }
  laser {
    relative_to = "body";
    history = 0;          # if set to 0, transform will not be updated
    update_channel = "";  # ignored since history = 0
    initial_transform {
      translation = [ 0, 0, 0 ];
      rpy = [ 0, 0, 0 ];
    }
  }
  camera {
    relative_to = "body";
    history = 0;
    initial_transform {
      translation = [ 0, 0, 0 ];
      rodrigues = [ 0, 0, 0 ];
    }
  }
  # ...
}
```
