#
#
# ``find_dependency()`` wraps a :command:`find_package` call for a package
# dependency. It is designed to be used in a <package>Config.cmake file, and it
# forwards the correct parameters for QUIET and REQUIRED which were passed to
# the original :command:`find_package` call.  It also sets an informative
# diagnostic message if the dependency could not be found.
#
# Any additional arguments specified are forwarded to :command:`find_package`.
