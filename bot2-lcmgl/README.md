# RobotLocomotion Fork of bot2-lcmgl

*C library and viewer for transmitting and rendering OpenGL commands over LCM*

![CI](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/libbot2/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

bot2-lcmgl contains a set of client libraries in C, Java, and Python for
transmitting OpenGL commands over LCM. It also provides routines for receiving
and rendering these commands in either a standalone application
(`bot-lcmgl-viewer`), or incorporated into another C/C++ application.

A nice attribute of the client libraries is that they do not depend on any
OpenGL libraries, and only require LCM.
